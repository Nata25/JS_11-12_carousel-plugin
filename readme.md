don't try to repeat this in real life

## HOW TO USE

Initialize .jqcarousel() method on the container of your carousel


Inside the container, put .carousel-frame and .carousel-controls. They should be siblings


Style .jqcarousel-frame as you like and set its width â€“ that's how wide you carousel will be

.jqcarousel-frame's width is a custom value but is used inside script to identify shift.

Make sure .jqcarousel-frame has overflow property set to hidden


Carousel items, or slides, go inside .carousel-frame and should be wrapped with .jqcarousel-content

If slides have uncontrolled margins, set their float to "left", otherwise px per step would be miscalculated

(e.g., figure with display: inline-block property get whitespace around even if margins are set to 0)


Width of .jqcarousel-content should be really great so that all slides would fit it (use something like 10000px)

Items inside .jqcarousel-content (figures, listitems, images etc.) should have display: inline-block property

Controls go inside .jqcarousel-controls container; left control should be first-child and right - last-child of the container


CUSTOMIZE WITH OPTIONS:

speed : speed of animation in miliseconds (500 by default)


easing : animation flow, string ("linear" by default)


cyclic : should carousel go all the way round or stop after last slide (true by default)

cyclic here means going smoothly to the first slide when at end click right control and go to the last slide when at start and click left control


slides : number of slides to be shown in the carousel at once
